### Autoregressive 3D Bounding Box Prediction

Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
We provide two Jupyter notebooks:
1. `visualize_data.ipynb` which lets you visualize data samples from our new dataset `COB-3D`. We provide code to visualize 2D masks and 3D bounding boxes.
2. `inference_example.ipynb` which lets you run inference with our newly proposed model architecture for the 3D Bounding Box Estimation tasks (-> predicting 3D bounding boxes from 2D segmentation.)
